Vagrant
=======

This project is distributed with a Vagrantfile intended to be used by
developers to run functional tests on a Linux virtual machine.

The software provided by the appliance are:
- Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS appliance running inside Virtual Box
- The collectd provided by Ubuntu
- Python 2.7 and 3.4 provided by Ubuntu
- This plugin
- Project dependencies provided by PIP as specified by project requirements

To use Vagrant to test this plugin you have to install following software
up to date software on your host machine:
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox 5


Vagrant
-------

Documentation to install Vagrant can be found on there website at

    https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/

A recent version of Vagrant is required to utilize the vagrant file provided by
this repo. If you have an older version already installed please upgrade by
following the documentation at

    https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/upgrading.html


Virtual Box
-----------

Virtual Box version greater than 5 should works fine.

Many Linux distributions should provide a valid version of VirtualBox.

The Virtual Box web site hosts some documentation and links to help you
downloading and installing Virtual Box on your machine. Please see it there:

    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads


Proxy configuration
-------------------

If you are working beside a proxy server then you have to install
vagrant-proxyconf plugin::

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf

You can have more details about the plugin on below site:

    https://github.com/tmatilai/vagrant-proxyconf

To use it, before creating target appliance, you have to configure standard
enviroment variable on your host machine like below::

    export http_proxy=http://<some_proxy_server>:<some_port>/
    export https_proxy=$https_proxy
    export no_proxy=localhost,$(hostname)


Create and use the appliance
----------------------------

Once all required software is installed and configured you can create
and launch the appliance as follows (it can take several minutes) from
the project folder::

    vagrant up

Once the appliance is running connect to the running VM you can type following::

    vagrant ssh

During the provisioning process collectd and ceilometer are going to be
installed and launched using devstack. To force updating the project and
restacking it again please use one of the following commands::

   # when the machine is down and I want to take it up, update the software
   # and start all services (including collectd and ceilometer)
   vagrant up --provision

   # when the machine is running and I want to take reboot it, update the
   # software and re-start all services (including collectd and ceilometer)
   vagrant reload --provision


To launch unit tests inside the appliance you can type following::

    vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant && tox'
