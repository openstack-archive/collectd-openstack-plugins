      Convention for heading levels in collectd-ceilometer-plugin documentation:

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

Enabling Alarms for plugin metrics/meters
=========================================

This guide provides a description of what Aodh features are available when the
collectd-gnocchi plugin is enabled. It provides a list of the alarms that can be
 created and how to create them.

collectd-gnocchi-plugin
-----------------------

There are three types of gnocchi based alarms that can be created using Aodh:

- gnocchi_resources_threshold
- gnocchi_aggregation_by_metrics_threshold
- gnocchi_aggregation_by_resources_threshold

 .. note::

       Currently, the metrics created by the collectd-gnocchi-plugin don't
       support the creation of gnocchi_resources_threshold alarms or
       gnocchi_aggregation_by_resources_threshold alarms.

To create a simple gnocchi_aggregation_by_metrics_threshold alarm:

- Type the following;

::

  aodh alarm create

- In the same command specify the name, type, metrics, threshold and
  aggregation method of your desired alarm. This alarm can be defined for one
  or a list of metrics.

::

  --name <ALARM_NAME>
  -t gnocchi_aggregation_by_metrics_threshold
  --threshold <THRESHOLD>
  --metrics <LIST_OF_METRICS>
  --aggregation-method <AGGREGATION_METHOD>


collectd-ceilometer-plugin
--------------------------

When this plugin is enabled threshold alarms can be defined for the new meters
that enabling this plugin generates.

- Threshold alarms can be created for meters via the following command;

::

  aodh alarm create
  --name <ALARM_NAME>
  -t threshold
  -m <METER_NAME>
  --threshold <THRESHOLD>


Event Alarms
------------

Event alarms can be created for any gnocchi metric. They would be triggered based
 on the status of the event defined for the alarm.

- To create event alarms enter the following command;

::

  aodh alarm create
  --name <ALARM_NAME>
  -t event
  --event-type <EVENT_TYPE>


Composite Alarms
----------------

Like event alarms, composite alarms can be created for the gnocchi plugin.
A composite alarm is created by combining more than one type of alarm.
Hence you can combine alarms based on Gnocchi metrics with alarms from other
sources.

- Composite alarms are generated by the following command;

::

  aodh alarm create
  --name <ALARM_NAME>
  -t composite
  --composite-rule <COMPOSITE_RULE>
