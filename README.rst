      -------  Heading 1

      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

==========================

OpenStack Ceilometer plugin for collectd.

This plugin for collectd publishes telemetry data gathered by collectd to
Ceilometer. This enables a more comprehensive telemetry set to be made
available to Ceilometer which will enable smarter scheduling and environmental
service assurance monitoring.
