    Fixes 'bug 1656063 https://bugs.launchpad.net/collectd-openstack-plugins/+bug/1656063'.
    OS_AUTH_URL now uses KEYSTONE_AUTH_URI instead of KEYSTONE_SERVICE_URI.
    Previously, the URL needed to be changed after deployment because the admin
    url was being used for Keystone, instead of the public url used for
    obtainining auth tokens. There's no longer a need to adjust the
    configuration file after deployment.
