  - This change includes the addition of the collectd plugin for Aodh. It
    allows collectd notifications to be sent to Aodh, where an alarm is
    created. The notifications used to create the alarms can be catergorized
    into threshold and event alarms. If the notification is triggered based
    on the breaking of a threshold rule then a threshold alarm is created in
    aodh, otherwise an event alarm is created. Tests have also been provided
    for this change.
