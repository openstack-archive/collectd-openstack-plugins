    In the rocky cycle, several changes were made to the testing structure of
    the collectd-openstack-plugins repo to conform to the new python testing
    interface (PTI). Use of upper constraints was introduced, stestr was
    adopted as the default test runner and sphinx-build became the default
    docs building command.
