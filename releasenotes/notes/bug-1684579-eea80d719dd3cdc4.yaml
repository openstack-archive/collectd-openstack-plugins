    Fixes 'bug 1684579 https://bugs.launchpad.net/collectd-ceilometer-plugin/+bug/1684579'.
    Removed the creation of a back-up directory for all of the .conf files,
    instead renamed them to .conf.b. This prevents that back-ups being read
    if the original is deleted, thus preventing that service to run when it is
    not configured properly.
