   Fixes 'bug 1681392 https://bugs.launchpad.net/collectd-ceilometer-plugin/+bug/1681392'.
   Changed the way the state of the alarm is set to depend on the severity of
   the notification sent. Messages are subject to change based on the collectd
   plugin that sent the notification. This is a more reliable method to set the
   state of an alarm.

   Fixes 'bug 1672301 https://bugs.launchpad.net/collectd-ceilometer-plugin/+bug/1672301'.
   Changed the why the state of an alarm is set thus reducing the possibility
   that it will result in an "insufficient data" state.
