   Included a new feature that allows you to specify the severity of any alarm
   created by a meter/metric. This can be specified in the local.conf using the
   configuration option "COLLECTD_AODH_SEVERITIES" and will be configured on
   deployment with devStack. If left unset the an alarms severity will default
   to "moderate". Included more detailed usage instructions in devStackGSG.rst
   for this new feature.
